In this paper we talk about different statistical models to predict the sequence of DNA. Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the hereditary material in all living beings, which stores information as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism. DNA bases pair up with each other, A with T and C with G, to form units called base pairs. DNA has a double-helical structure, somewhat like a ladder, with the base pairs forming the ladderâ€™s rungs. Biologists are interested in C and G rich DNA, meaning DNA with high C and G compared to A and T. Basically, DNA with high C and G are more stable in nature compared to A and T.
We can use certain statistical models of probability distributions to generate random sequences for discrete data of DNA samples. The mixture model with A, C, T and G are shown below. The first and the second die are given by biologists,
where the first die is C and G rich and the second die is C and G poor. The third dice is fair and so that probabilities of getting an A, C, G, T are equal i.e. 0.25.
